              <h3>Computer Science Instructing:</h3>
            <p>
              I’ve been a private Computer Science instructor for the last three years. 
              I’ve taught as many as 26 students at once, ages 5 to 42. I specialize in 
              teaching Python and C++ curricula focusing on Object Oriented Programming, 
              Data Structures, Algorithms, Game Development, Artificial Intelligence, 
              Machine Learning, and Competitive Programming. I have developed my own 
              lesson plans and curriculum, each course with over 20+ projects designed 
              to last four months.

            ACM-W has been an enormous part of my college career, and this year I have been 
            given the responsibility of leading our organization. On top of general 
            executive decisions, I’ve done various jobs, from teaching <a href="https://github.com/ananyapags/Apple-Viper" target="_blank"
            >technical</a>/behavioral 
            lectures to organizing and finding corporate relations. This year my most 
            prominent task was managing the undertaking of our largest hackathon 
            ever: Hack for Humanity. I aim to build a community where we all are connected, 
            constantly learning about tech and regularly striving to impact the world positively.
