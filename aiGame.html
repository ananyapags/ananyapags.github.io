              <h3>Building an unbeatable AI</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
    
            After watching the AlphaGo documentary, I was determined to set foot in the world of 
            gaming AI.
            </p>
            <p>
             
            I created a simple program with if-else statements for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Knowing that such an 
            algorithm wasn't foolproof, I began to do more research on an 
            undefeatable sound program. With further research, I learned about the importance of 
            having a model for your game, which led me to build a game tree for my scenario. 
            Using OOP, I created a   <a href="https://github.com/ananyapags/ubeatable-AI" target="_blank" > model class</a> for my gameplay, allowing whatever algorithm I 
            deploy on top of it to have a well-managed space complexity. With this, I could 
            apply Breadth First Search to traverse through the tree to find the most efficient 
            way for AI to win. Knowing there are even more ways to improve run time, I explored 
            fast searching algorithms, like MiniMax and A*. I chose to go with A* and Minimax, as they had the smallest space complexity
            and allowed the computer only to keep track of things that matter.

              <h3>Stepping up: more complex layouts</h3>

            <p>
              Now that 
              I have developed my ultimate algorithm, I understand how to set up an efficient AI. 
              It was time to apply this knowledge to games other than Tic-Tac-Toe. Here is an application of my work in a
